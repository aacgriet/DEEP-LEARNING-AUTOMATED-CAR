# DEEP-LEARNING-AUTOMATED-CAR

The Autonomous Car is an open source DIY self-driving platform for small scale cars based on a raspberry pi computer, a camera, and servo shield board to interface with the R/C car. We drive the vehicle around a lined car to capture images and steering angles, which trains a neural-network autopilot to drive itself around the track. Top speeds around corners are about 4-6mph.While collecting training data, the car itself doesnâ€™t do all that much. It basically takes pictures and sends them to an amazon server and gets servo commands in return. The server is where magic happens.
First collects the images and driving information from the user manually driving the car around the track. The default way to do this on the donkey is via the mobile friendly web page delivered by the server. The mobile web page even has a live video view of what the car sees and a virtual joystick. The server records the data from a person driving the car, then uses those images and joystick positions to train a TensorFlow neural network model in software. This happens quickly-a full trip latency takes about 1/10 second once trained, model can be loaded on the car .This uses the supervised learning technique often referred to as behavioural cloning like HVI/F library and CAN library along with HV controller-[which includes velocity control, shift control, communication, mode management, angle control, steer torque control, exception, pedal control, DA/AD].
